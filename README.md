# MPSI

This is MPSI: a native macOS installer for the Oculus Quest game Pavlov: Shack.

# Usage

To use MPSI, download the app from the releases page. To open it up right click MPSI.app and click open. You may need to repeat this until the app actually opens. It should be pretty self explanatory from there.

# Uh, where's the source code?

I'm working on it!!! Probably!!!

In all seriousness I made the XCode project before I started using Github, so it'll be a hassle to get it going. My next project (which will be related to this one) will most likely be open source from the start.
